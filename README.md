# LibSession-Util Swift Package Manager

## What is this?
This is a repo to expose releases of [LibSession-Util](https://github.com/session-foundation/libsession-util) so that it can be consumed as a Swift Package.

This is a separate repo because Swift Package Manager does a full clone when retrieving it's dependencies and, with it's submodules, `LibSession-Uril` ends up being over 750Mb causing issues with the CI (and probably being annoying for contributers).

## Version

* This Package: *1.5.0*
* LibSession-Util: *v1.5.0*
